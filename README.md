## Pokedex Task

I like so muck pokemons and I thinked if I can make some interesting project with using API requests but with this topic. And yes I did it now!
In this task I built my own pok√©dex! What it is pokedex? It is small telephone/computer which help to catch, to explore and to identify pokemons.
In my project I used [API](https://pokeapi.co/)

# Pokedex

Now I want to tell you what my Pokedex knows to do.

- Search pokemons by ID or Name(he is non-sensitive to case)
- Show Pockemon name height weight image and pokemon types of searched pokemon
- Image changes to back_default on hover
- It have not found message if the API return it (case the pockemon doesnt exist)
- On click on one of the pockemon types show list of all the pokemons names that related to this type
- On Click on one of the pockemon name change the pokedex context by changing the input value to the name of the pockemon
- It has next-pokemon-button that can show you the pokemon with next ID number
- Also the same previous-pokemon-button

# Bonuses:

1. I uses fetch and axios in different function to send requests
2. I used bootstrap for efficient and easy design of same elements
3. Added icons of next and previous arrows

# Conclusions:

If you have some questions or proposotion how to improve my project you can leave comment in GitHub or send me to my Email.
ALso if you want to make your own pokedex you can do it and after that we will can to compare them.
Good luck!
